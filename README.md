# pcislocked-bot
A simple autoresponder and logging discord bot written in discord.py, used at pcislocked discord server privately

edit: discord.js part was a joke because discord.py itself is just painful to use, but here you go Mr. CBT



This bot is more or less hardcoded to work on my server ONLY but you can always create a fork and implement it for your own server. You can't add bot itself to other servers.
